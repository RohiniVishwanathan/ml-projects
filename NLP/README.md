Natural Language Processing Portfolio – Rohini Vishwanathan
This folder contains my natural language processing coursework and applied projects completed as part of a graduate-level NLP class at Claremont Graduate University.
The work spans the full NLP pipeline—preprocessing, feature engineering, vectorization, topic modeling, BERT embedding, and text classification—applied on real-world datasets such as Yelp reviews.
Each lab includes both:
A Jupyter Notebook (code)
A PDF report (summary + results)
🔹 Contents
Lab 1: Text Preprocessing
Cleaning → tokenization → lemmatization → stopword removal
Built a preprocessing pipeline using NLTK and spaCy
Removed punctuation, digits, and noise
Prepared clean token sets for downstream modeling

Lab 2: Basic NLP Functions
Utility NLP methods for downstream feature engineering
Implemented normalization, tokenization, POS tagging, stemming
Created reusable helper functions for analysis pipelines
