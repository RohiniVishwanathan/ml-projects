# Data Mining, Machine Learning & NLP Portfolio – Rohini Vishwanathan

This repository showcases my end-to-end work across **data mining**, **machine learning**, and **natural language processing**, completed as part of my graduate studies in the MS Information Science & Technology (Data Science & Analytics) program at Claremont Graduate University.

The portfolio highlights full analytical workflows used in real-world ML development — from data preprocessing to modeling, evaluation, and business interpretation.

- Handling missingness, noise, and skewed distributions  
- Standardization, normalization, and variable transformation  

### **Classification Models**
- Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest  
- Confusion matrices, ROC analysis  
- Feature importance and interpretability  

### **Clustering**
- K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
- Distance measures & cluster evaluation  

### **Association Rule Mining**
- Apriori algorithm  
- Rule strength interpretation (support, confidence, lift)  

### **Neural Networks**
- Multi-layer perceptrons built with Keras  
- Hyperparameter tuning and optimization  
- Learning curves and validation performance  

### **Ensemble Modeling**
- Ensemble-based model comparison  
- Metrics used: **Accuracy**, **Lift**, **Stability**  

### **HR Attrition Prediction (QBA Internship Project)**
- Full EDA & feature analysis  
- Logistic regression model  
- Insight-focused business recommendations  

All ML reports (PDFs) are stored in the `/reports/` folder.  
Corresponding notebooks reside in the repository root.

- Noise reduction and normalization  

### **Utility NLP Functions**
- POS tagging, stemming, text normalization  

### **Word Vectorization & Sentiment Analysis**
- Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec  
- VADER & TextBlob sentiment scoring  

### **Transformer-Based Embeddings**
- BERT / DistilBERT embeddings  
- Contextual vectorization and embedding comparison  

### **Text Classification**
- Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting  
- Dimensionality reduction (SVD)  

### **Topic Modeling**
- LSA with BoW and TF-IDF  
- LDA with coherence tuning  
- pyLDAvis visualizations  

### **Take-Home NLP Exam**
- Hybrid feature engineering (TF-IDF + LIWC + metadata)  
- Model building for psychological trait prediction  
- Evaluation & model selection with interpretability focus  

Each NLP lab includes both **a Jupyter Notebook** and **a PDF report**.
